If you want to make updates to a project, it's important to follow the proper protocol to ensure that the main branch remains stable and functional. Instead of directly committing changes to the main branch, it's recommended that you create your own branch.

By creating your own branch, you have a separate workspace to experiment and make changes without affecting the main codebase. This also allows others on the team to review your changes and provide feedback before they're merged into the main branch.

Once you've made your updates and received approval from your team, it's time to merge your branch with the main branch. This can be done easily and without disrupting the workflow of other contributors. By following this process, you can maintain the stability and quality of your project while also allowing for efficient collaboration among team members.
